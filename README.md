Inserting text in an Image and then sending it through Email

Inserting a text in an image and then sending it through email seems like a plain and simple task. But when we have to enter different names numerous times in an image(for eg. Competition Certificate or some course certificate) and emailing it to different people becomes very burdensome and inconvenient. This Code Snippet is made for inserting a text into an Image. And then sending it to various other people via mail.

In this the major modules that I have used are:
**** "Pandas" module to import the names and their email contacts
**** "PIL" module to draw the text onto the image
**** "smtplib" module to send email
